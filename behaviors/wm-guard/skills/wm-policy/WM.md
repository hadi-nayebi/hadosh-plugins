    This policy document defines the runtime rules for the WM enforcement system. It is loaded automatically by opencode.json and must remain aligned with the plugin behavior, command templates, and AGENTS.md. Keep it in the skills compartment so all behavior guidance is colocated. Update this document whenever enforcement rules or repair workflows change to avoid drift.
