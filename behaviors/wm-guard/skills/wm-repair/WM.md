    This skill definition provides the repair loop for WM enforcement. It explains how to respond to WM-STATUS warnings, run the correct command template, and expand commentary to meet the 50-word threshold. It also addresses the >10 items rule and ensures reads are retried after fixes. Use it whenever the plugin blocks a read or emits warnings that require remediation.
