description: Generate 50+ word WM.md commentary entries for files and subdirs
---
## What I do
- Draft 50+ word commentary entries that explain purpose, usage, risks, and future reminders.
- Ensure entries are concrete even when file contents are unknown.

## When to use me
- When creating or expanding `<file>` or `<subdir>` entries in WM.md.
- When a WM-STATUS warning indicates entries are under 50 words.

## Guidelines
- Mention what the file/subdir likely contains and why it exists.
- Note dependencies, owners, or future checks if known.
- Add a reminder of what to verify when you read it later.
- See `EXAMPLES.md` for strong commentary patterns and anti-patterns.
