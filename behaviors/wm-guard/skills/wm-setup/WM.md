    This skill definition guides the agent through setting up WM policy context in a project. It focuses on aligning AGENTS.md with the runtime policy, verifying the opencode.json instruction pointer, and ensuring WM.md exists in the root directory. Use it when a project lacks clear WM guidance or after migrations. Update the skill if the policy location or required AGENTS.md content changes.
