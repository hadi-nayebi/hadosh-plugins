  <file path="wm-guard.js">
    The enforcement plugin for the WM guard organ. It validates WM.md chains, blocks reads when commentary is missing or stale, injects WM.md into read outputs, and emits WM-STATUS warnings for diagnostic tools. It also guards rm and mv operations and logs reminders on file changes. Changes here should be coordinated with the plan, command templates, and skills.
