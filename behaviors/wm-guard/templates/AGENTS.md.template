# WM Policy (Project-Level)

This project enforces a WM.md chain for memory and context.

## Core Rules
- Use the built-in `read` tool only; plugin injects WM.md chain on every read.
- If a read is blocked, immediately run `/wm-init` or `/wm-sync` and retry.
- WM.md must include `<directory-commentary>` with `<file>` and `<subdir>` entries; each entry is 50+ words.
- Do not add entries for `WM.md` itself.
- Directory listings and searches are diagnostics and emit WM-STATUS only.

## Organization Constraints
- No directory should exceed 10 items without `<exception>` or `<note type="reorg">`.

## Compartment Model
- Outside: paths outside `./` (blocked by default).
- Inside: `./` root and normal subdirectories.
- Brain: `.opencode/`.
- Side projects: `./<project_name>/` treated as normal subtrees.

## Repair Loop
- On any WM-STATUS warning, run `/wm-sync <dir>` for the affected directory.
- For onboarding or drift correction, run `/wm-setup` or invoke `@wm-steward`.
