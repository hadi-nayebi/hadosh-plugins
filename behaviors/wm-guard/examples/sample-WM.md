  <file path="README.md">
    The primary entry point for users installing the organ. It describes the behavior model, install steps, and how to update. If the enforcement logic or setup scripts change, update this file so guidance stays aligned with reality. It is often the first thing readers see when context is appended.
  </file>
  <subdir path="commands/">
    This directory contains the command templates that drive WM repair and maintenance. The templates are procedural memory for the organ, so they should stay in lockstep with plugin behavior and policy. When adding or changing commands, also update skills and README notes to avoid drift.
