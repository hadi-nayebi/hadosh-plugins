<directory-commentary>
  <subdir path="memory_management/">
    This directory groups agents dedicated to WM enforcement and memory layer maintenance. It contains the subagent used for repairs, audits, and setup tasks. Keep its contents aligned with the WM policy and plan so the agent continues to reinforce the correct behavior. Add new agent entries here whenever additional memory-management roles are introduced.
