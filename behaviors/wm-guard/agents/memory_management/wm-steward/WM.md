    This file defines the WM Steward subagent that handles setup, repair, and audit tasks for the WM layer. It outlines responsibilities, tool usage, and self-improvement expectations so the subagent can keep the system aligned. The prompt should stay consistent with the WM policy, command templates, and plugin behavior. Update it whenever the enforcement process changes or new skills are added.
