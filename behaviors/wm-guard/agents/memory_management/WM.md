  <subdir path="wm-steward/">
    This subdirectory contains the WM stewardship subagent definition. The agent is invoked to repair WM-STATUS issues, run audits, and perform setup tasks that keep the WM layer consistent. Its prompt should remain aligned with the current policy, commands, and skills so it can take correct actions. Update this entry if the agent’s responsibilities or structure change.
