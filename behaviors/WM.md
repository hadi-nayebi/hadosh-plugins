  <subdir path="wm-guard/">
    The WM guard organ directory. This is the first behavior in the repository and acts as the reference implementation for organ structure. It contains the enforcement plugin, repair commands, commentary skills, and the steward subagent. Keep its layout consistent so future behaviors can mirror the same architecture and reuse the organ model.
